//! What a run leaves behind for the next one: the committed lineage, the
//! request bytes, and the frame that produced them.
//!
//! `tests/history.rs` covers the cross-run splice by seeding run two *by
//! hand* — it hardcodes what run one committed, because at the time nothing
//! reported it. These tests close that loop: run two is seeded from run one's
//! own [`RunOutcome`], which is exactly what `crates/api` does through the
//! spine (`history-abstract.md` H7).
