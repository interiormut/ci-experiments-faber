//! An inbound stop, observable from inside a run.
//!
//! `abstract.md` is explicit that nothing reaches into a running loop to
//! steer it: control is exercised by subtraction of capability, and
//! "cancellation surfaces as an ordinary failure the harness has to deal
//! with." That is all this is. Raising the flag unwinds nothing — it makes
//! the next *outbound* step fail: a model stream being advanced, or a tool
//! being invoked, rejects exactly the way a dead provider connection does,
//! carrying the `cancelled` kind `types.d.ts` already reserves for it. What
//! happens next is the harness's own decision, which is the point: a loop
//! that wants to commit what it has, or say one last thing before it stops,
//! still can.
//!
//! `history-abstract.md` H9.3 stays open past this. A harness doing local
//! work between calls never touches an op, so it cannot observe the flag at
//! all; closing that needs a signal on `ctx` threaded into the harness's own
//! code, which is an unresolved type-surface question. Killing the isolate
//! ([`HarnessRun::terminate`](crate::HarnessRun::terminate)) remains the
//! backstop for that case — the backstop, as H9.3 says, and not the
//! mechanism.
