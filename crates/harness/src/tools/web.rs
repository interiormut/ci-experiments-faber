//! Web search, projected as a tool.
//!
//! A second projection beside [`Surface`](super::Surface), and deliberately not
//! part of it: search runs against no target, has no root, and answers nothing
//! the environment contract describes. Sharing a module would mean a second
//! carve-out in a surface whose whole shape is "every call names the machine it
//! runs on".
//!
//! What this projection has to preserve, because the crate below it went to the
//! trouble of keeping the distinctions apart:
//!
//! - **A query that matched nothing is a result.** It comes back with
//!   `is_error` false and says the search ran, because "no such thing exists on
//!   the web" is an answer a model will act on and must not be manufactured
//!   from a backend that never got asked.
//! - **A backend that could not be asked is a fault**, and its message says the
//!   query itself is untouched — the same repair instruction an unreachable
//!   environment carries, for the same reason.
//! - **Engines that failed are named.** Thin results with half the upstreams
//!   unresponsive is a degraded instance, not a thin web, and a renderer that
//!   drops that teaches the model the wrong lesson about the world.
//! - **The instance that served is echoed**, so a transcript says where an
//!   answer came from rather than implying the web spoke with one voice.
