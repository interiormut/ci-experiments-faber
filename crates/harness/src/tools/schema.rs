//! The tool definitions, as bytes in the prefix.
//!
//! Three properties this file exists to hold still.
//!
//! **The schema is a constant.** It is not built from the bindings, not
//! filtered by what any target can do, and not rebuilt when a target is bound
//! mid-session. Tool definitions sit near the top of the request and every
//! byte after them is cached against them, so a schema that varied with the
//! binding set would invalidate the whole prefix each time a user added an
//! environment — and would make binding mid-run impossible rather than merely
//! expensive. Capability lives in the manifest, which is data at the end of
//! the context, and a call against a target that cannot answer it is denied
//! with the capability named.
//!
//! **`target` is required on every call and never defaulted.** It is a plain
//! string, not an enum of bound labels — an enum would put the bindings back
//! into the schema through the side door. A defaulted target means a forgotten
//! parameter silently routes to a machine the model was not thinking about,
//! and the failures that produces are the destructive ones: an `rm -rf`, a
//! migration, a service restart on the wrong host. An omitted required
//! parameter is a validation error the model repairs in one turn.
//!
//! **A description says what the model must know before it calls; the result
//! says what happened.** Every sentence here is prefix rent paid on every
//! request of every session, and a sentence describing the *shape of the
//! answer* is rent paid for something [`render`](super::render) already says on
//! the one turn it matters. So: no restating that a nonzero exit is a result,
//! that a truncated listing says so, that a refusal is deterministic. What
//! stays is what cannot be recovered from a result the model has not received
//! yet — that `cwd` does not persist, that a patch is not atomic, that `old`
//! must be unique.
