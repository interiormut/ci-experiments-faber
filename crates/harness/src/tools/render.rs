//! Turning what an environment answered into what the model reads.
//!
//! This is the projection, and it is where the environment layer's guarantees
//! either survive or quietly disappear. Three of them are easy to lose here and
//! are therefore written out at every site:
//!
//! - **A nonzero exit is a result.** It is rendered as an outcome line, never
//!   as an error, and `is_error` is reserved for the two failure classes.
//! - **Truncation is always flagged.** A capped result the model reads as
//!   complete is worse than no result: it ends the search with a wrong answer
//!   instead of an incomplete one.
//! - **Every result echoes `target:path`.** No unqualified path enters the
//!   transcript, because `/src/main.rs` denotes a different file per target and
//!   a transcript that does not say which one cannot be replayed or reviewed.
