//! The internal contract every transport implements.
//!
//! Async and object-safe on purpose. SSH and docker are the reason this
//! abstraction exists, and a [`Registry`](crate::Registry) addressing labels
//! holds targets as `dyn Target` — so the trait is written through
//! `#[async_trait]` rather than with native async fns, which are not
//! `dyn`-compatible.
//!
//! **The design target is that the same transcript, replayed against a
//! different target of the same capability class, produces the same calls**
//! Not the same results — the same calls. Anything that makes the agent
//! write mode-specific commands is a defect in an implementation of this
//! trait.
//!
//! Three families of verb are absent by decision, not omission:
//!
//! - **No health or status verb**. The agent would gate on it and
//!   then blame a stale answer for a failure the attempt would have reported
//!   correctly. The authoritative answer is the call.
//! - **No lifecycle verb**. No create, start, stop, remove, or restart of
//!   a host or container. Process lifecycle is in scope; container lifecycle is
//!   not, and an agent that can restart its own container can destroy the state
//!   a user is mid-way through inspecting.
//! - **No bind or discover verb**. The agent cannot bind, and
//!   enumeration reaches bound labels only, never the host.
