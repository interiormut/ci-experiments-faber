//! Execution inside a container, over the Engine API.
//!
//! This module is one exec mode and *both* of its transports. `local+docker`
//! and `ssh+docker` differ only in which [`Daemon`] they are handed: the
//! difference is which socket gets dialled, and everything above that — exec,
//! archive, framing, signals — is written once. A second transport is a second
//! `Daemon`, not a second copy of this.
//!
//! What a container buys, and what it therefore publishes:
//!
//! - [`Scope::Container`] — the root is the container's filesystem rather than
//!   a directory on a machine carrying much more.
//! - [`Posture::Enforced`] — the substrate holds the boundary. Unlike direct
//!   execution, a shell command that walks out of the root does not get out,
//!   so the refusal is backed rather than conventional.
//! - [`Capability::Pty`] is still not advertised. The Engine API offers a TTY
//!   and it would work, but a TTY exec stops multiplexing its output, so
//!   stdout and stderr arrive merged — and quietly folding stderr into stdout
//!   is a worse failure than not offering the capability.
//!
//! Container lifecycle stays absent, exactly as elsewhere. There is no start,
//! stop, restart, or remove here, and a stopped container is reported rather
//! than started: it may be stopped deliberately, and an agent that can restart
//! its own container can destroy what a user is mid-way through inspecting.
//! File verbs still work against a stopped container, because the archive
//! endpoints do not need it running — so a stopped container degrades to a
//! readable one rather than to nothing.
