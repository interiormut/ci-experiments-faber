//! Failure classes distinct in the type, not in a string.
//!
//! Two classes reach this type, and the agent's correct repair differs for
//! each: [`Fault::Denied`] means the API refused deterministically — do not
//! retry, the request was malformed — and [`Fault::Unreachable`] means the
//! transport failed, so do not edit the command, the machine is gone.
//!
//! The third class is not here on purpose. A command that ran and terminated
//! is [`Exit`](crate::Exit), whatever its exit code, and a command that hung
//! is [`Outcome::TimedOut`](crate::Outcome). Collapsing either into an error
//! teaches the model to debug its shell script when the SSH tunnel dropped
//!.
//!
//! [`Denial`] is wider than the original four variants because it needs to be: a
//! malformed regex, an offset past the end, a nonexistent path, and a
//! genuinely empty match set are four different results and never share a
//! representation. Three of those four are refusals, and the original
//! `PathEscape | MissingCapability | Disabled | NotBound` has nowhere to put
//! them.
