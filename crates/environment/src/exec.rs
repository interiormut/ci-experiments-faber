//! Running commands, and what running one produces.
//!
//! The shape follows the common execution contract, with three amendments applied:
//!
//! - A1 — every [`Exit`] echoes the resolved `cwd` and the target label, so
//!   the transcript carries the resolution rather than implying it.
//! - A2 — captured output is both a [`Span`] (for the exchange) and a path
//!   under the target's root (for the agent, which can `rg` a path and cannot
//!   `rg` a ref).
//! - A6 — [`Target::stdin`](crate::Target::stdin) exists, because
//!   `start`/`output`/`signal` cannot answer an interactive prompt or drive a
//!   REPL.
