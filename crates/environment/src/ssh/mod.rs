//! Execution on another machine, over SSH.
//!
//! One session serves everything: commands run on their own channels, files
//! move over the SFTP subsystem on another, and a container daemon on the far
//! side is reached by forwarding to its socket over a third. So an SSH host
//! used in docker mode still costs one connection and one authentication.
//!
//! **Everything is passed in at bind.** The address, the user, the key
//! material, and the expected host key are all arguments. Nothing here reads
//! `~/.ssh/config`, `known_hosts`, an agent socket, or any environment
//! variable — on a shared deployment those describe the operator, and
//! borrowing them would send a user's connection out under the operator's
//! identity and the operator's trust decisions.
//!
//! Two consequences worth stating plainly:
//!
//! - **Host keys are checked against something the caller supplied**, because
//!   there is no file here to consult. [`HostKey::AcceptNew`] exists for the
//!   first connection and reports what it saw so the caller can store it;
//!   after that, [`HostKey::Verify`] is the whole point.
//! - **Background handles die with the session.** Reattaching after a dropped
//!   connection needs a supervisor process on the far side, which is
//!   lifecycle, and lifecycle is not Faber's. A call against a dead handle
//!   reports that the machine went away, and the agent restarts the work.
