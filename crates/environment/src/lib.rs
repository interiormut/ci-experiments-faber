//! Execution targets: reach a machine, then exec and edit files on it.
//!
//! Implements the internal environment contract and its tool-surface amendments.
//!
//! What this crate is *not*: the model-facing tool surface. The tools are a
//! projection of this contract and the projection is per-model —
//! Codex-family against `shell`/`apply_patch`, Claude-family against
//! `Bash`/`Read`/`Write`/`Edit`. The n+m factoring only pays off if the
//! projection is a formatting decision, so the JSON schemas, tool names, and
//! rendering policy live with the harness and never here.
//!
//! What this crate also is not: coupled to the harness. It depends on neither
//! `llm` nor `harness`, and names no run, session, or exchange.
//!
//! The load-bearing pieces:
//!
//! - [`RootedPath`] — one rooted namespace, enforced at the API boundary
//!   in *all* modes, including direct, where nothing underneath enforces it.
//! - [`Fault`] — two failure classes distinct in the type; a nonzero exit
//!   is an [`Outcome`], not a failure, and a timeout is an outcome too.
//! - [`Manifest`] — capability published once at bind, never re-derived.
//! - [`Registry`] — labels, append-only, tombstoning rather than removal.
//! - [`Target`] — the agent-facing contract. [`Machine`] is its only
//!   implementation; a mode is a `Machine` over a different [`Spawn`] and
//!   [`Files`], so adding one is mechanism and never behavior.
