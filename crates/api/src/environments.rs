//! Reaching a user's machine from a request handler.
//!
//! Everything the `environment` crate does starts from something dialled, and
//! what to dial is always configuration passed in — never the process's own.
//! This module is the one place that configuration is assembled, and it
//! assembles it from the caller's own rows: `host.docker_endpoint`,
//! `host.ssh_address`, and the credential `host.ssh_key_ref` names. Faber runs
//! as a multi-user service, so `DOCKER_HOST`, `~/.ssh`, an agent socket, and a
//! docker context describe the operator and would send one user's work out
//! under another's identity. None of them is read here, and none should be.
//!
//! Two things are deliberately not cached: the SSH session and the daemon
//! connection. A `Daemon` opens a fresh connection per call by design, and a
//! session held between requests is a session that has to be invalidated when
//! a user rotates a key — reconnecting costs one round trip and owes nobody an
//! invalidation story.
