//! Agent-transport credentials — see `internal-docs/agent-transport.md`.
//!
//! Two tables, two different secrets. `agent_enrollment` holds the one-time
//! bootstrap token exchanged at first daemon run; `agent_credential` holds
//! the long-lived token every reconnect presents, plus the SSH host key
//! pinned at that same exchange. Neither `token_hash` is ever compared in
//! plaintext — both are looked up by hash and verified with a constant-time
//! comparison at the call site, the same shape as any bearer credential.
