//! What a session can be told to reach, and what it currently reaches.
//!
//! Two lists, deliberately different. `GET /api/environments` is what the
//! caller *could* tag — the source the client's `@` picker reads, so a name it
//! offers is a name that resolves. `GET /api/sessions/{id}/environments` is
//! what a session has actually been given, which is a subset and grows only
//! when a user tags one in a message.
//!
//! There is no route here that the model can reach. Binding is the user's:
//! enumeration reaches bound labels, never the machine, and nothing an agent
//! calls appears in this file.
