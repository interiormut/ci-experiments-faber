## Component layout

`components/ui/` is registry territory — every file in it is owned by either the
`@panit` registry (`https://ui.registry.panit.dev/r/{name}.json`) or shadcn, and
`shadcn add` overwrites it wholesale. Do not hand-edit anything there. A fix that
belongs to a registry component belongs upstream in the registry.

Faber-authored components live in feature folders alongside it:

- `components/shell/` — app frame: auth wiring, sidebar, profile menu
- `components/thread/` — the thread surface

Add a new folder when a feature earns one. To check whether a component is
registry-owned before touching it:

```sh
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" https://ui.registry.panit.dev/r/<name>.json
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" https://ui.shadcn.com/r/styles/radix-nova/<name>.json
```

## Dev server

Do not run `bun run dev` (or any dev server) unless explicitly instructed to, or you have an obvious reason that requires a live server. Prefer lint/typecheck/build for verification.
