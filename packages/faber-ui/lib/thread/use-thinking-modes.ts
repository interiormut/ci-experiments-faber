/**
 * How much of each thinking block is showing, and what a click on one does.
 *
 * The block's own default (`collapsed` ↔ `expanded`) is not what a run wants:
 * reasoning that is still arriving should peek, and reasoning that has stopped
 * should get out of the way. So mode is derived from two things — whether the
 * block is still streaming, which the transcript knows, and whether the user
 * has opened it, which is all this hook stores:
 *
 * | | not opened | opened |
 * | --- | --- | --- |
 * | streaming | `peek` | `expanded` |
 * | ended | `collapsed` | `expanded` |
 *
 * A block the user opened mid-stream therefore stays open when it ends, while
 * one left peeking folds away on its own. Closing a block is forgetting the
 * override rather than recording one, which is what makes both toggles the
 * spec asks for — `peek` ↔ `expanded` while streaming, `collapsed` ↔
 * `expanded` after — the same single piece of state.
