 * run's own container, which is the one thing about it we get to name.
 *
 * Document order is what matters, and `querySelectorAll` returns it: the last

 * Grows an invisible tail under the transcript so the newest block can sit in
 * the MIDDLE of the view rather than at its bottom edge.
 *
 * Autoscroll still pins to the bottom — see {@link useStickToBottom} — and this
 * hook only moves where "the bottom" is. A block near the end of a thread has
 * nothing under it to scroll into view, so without a tail the only place it can
 * come to rest is the bottom edge, reading like the end of a page rather than
 * the line being written. The tail is exactly the height that shortfall costs:
 * half a viewport, less whatever already sits below the block's top.
 *
 * So the tail SHRINKS as the block grows, and once the block is half a screen
 * tall it is gone entirely — a long streaming reply fills the view normally
 * instead of dragging half a screen of blank along behind it. While it shrinks
 * by the same amount the content grows, the scroll height holds still, which is
 * what keeps the block parked at the middle without anyone re-pinning it.
 *
 * Heights are written straight to the spacer instead of held in state: this
 * runs on every resize of a streaming row, and a render per token to move one
 * `height` is a lot of React for something the DOM can be told directly. It
 * also keeps the measurement in the layout phase, before autoscroll's own
 * effect reads `scrollHeight`.
