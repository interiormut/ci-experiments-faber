/**
 * The waiting half of the flow: hand over a command, then watch for the
 * daemon it installs to dial in.
 *
 * Everything here is scoped to one bootstrap token, which is shown once and
 * stored nowhere — a token issued and then lost is replaced by issuing
 * another, never by reading the old one back.
 *
 * The two calls arrive as props rather than being made here, and that is the
 * whole reason this component is shared rather than duplicated. A user
 * enrolling a machine of their own gets a daemon with their account's
 * authority; an administrator enrolling a machine faber operates gets one
 * running as root, because faber writes cgroup limits and filesystem quotas
 * through it. Those are different routes, gated differently, and the command
 * they hand back differs by a `sudo` and a `--system`. Everything below —
 * a token shown once, an hour to use it, a poll that stops the moment the
 * daemon appears — is the same either way.
